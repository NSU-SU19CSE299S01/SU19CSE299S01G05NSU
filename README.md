<h2 align="center"><ins><strong><u><strong>Project details</strong> </u></strong></ins></h2>
<p><ins><strong>Project idea:</strong></ins></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is about freelancing apps that&rsquo;ll help unemployed people especially the women who know to tailor, cooking, handicrafts, etc. to open a home business and can take orders from home also can deliver with the help of delivery service. They can use the app to be self-dependent without any large investment. One can post his or her service or skill on the app with proper details. Those who need the service can order the service, can select a payment method and can get delivered through delivery service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The problem I am trying to solve:</span> There are so many unemployed but skilled people where a large number are women. I am trying to convert a large number of skilled but unemployed, dependent people basically women into working and self-dependent women. Women won&rsquo;t be a burden anymore. People can earn with the help of their skill from home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The application will help unemployed people to be self-employed. They can use the app to be self-dependent without any large investment.Basically, earning by giving service using one&rsquo;s skill and hobby.</p>
<h2 align="center"><ins><strong><u>Features</u></strong></ins></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">-Launch map with POIS: This will return only Latitude and longitude.</p>

<h2 align="center"><ins><u><strong>Technology</strong></u></ins></h2>
<p><strong> 1. Back-End </strong></p>
<ol>
<ol>- Firebase</ol>
</ol>
<p>Firebase is platform which allow to build web and mobile applications without server side programming language. One can store users data on its real-time database which sync data among users data in no time.</p>
<p>For the app i have used Firebase Authentication, Real time database, Firebase Storage.</p>
<p><ins><u>Firebase Authentication:</u></ins> I have used this to manage user serssion and to authenticate user to the app. The app will authenticate on the basis of Email and Password.</p>
<p><ins><u>Firebase Storage:</u></ins> It is a stand-alone solution for uploading user generated content like images and videos from an iOS and Android device. I have used it to upload service images and profile pictures.</p>
<p><ins><u>Firebase Datbase:</u></ins> The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets me store and sync data between users in realtime.Database helps the app to store service information which the user input when adding a service. The app can also use the datas in real time .</p>
<p><strong> 2. Front-End </strong></p>
<p>- JAVA</p>
<p>- KOTLIN</p>
<p>Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the JVM and is completely interoperable with Java. Kotlin is an officially supported language for developing Android apps, along with Java.</p>
<p>- XML</p>
<p><strong> 3. IDE </strong></p>
<p>- Android Studio</p>
<h2 align="center"><ins><strong> <u>Monetization/Business plan</u></strong></ins></h2>
<p>There will basically two payment methods there is cash on delivery and Bkash. If any transaction for a service is made through cash on delivery or Bkash then the service provider will have to pay a small percentage of the transaction like 3 % through Bkash. If he or she doesn&rsquo;t pay the charge then his or her account will be blocked.</p>
<p>I will promote third-party brands and products and charge them to place their offer/ logo in the app or send out a push notification. I will list other businesses and promote a specific business to the top of the list.</p>
<p align="center"><ins><strong><u>Payment Methods</u></strong></ins></p>
<p>We will be using Bkash, Credit/Debit Cards as our basic payment methods for any kind of transactions.</p>

<p align="justify">The project is about freelancing apps that&rsquo;ll help unemployed people especially the women who know to tailor, cooking, handicrafts, etc. to open a home business and can take orders from home also can deliver with the help of delivery service.

Those who need the service can order the service, can select a payment method and can get delivered through delivery service.</p>
<p align="justify"><ins>The problem I am trying to solve</ins>: There are so many unemployed but skilled people where a large number are women. I am trying to convert a large number of skilled but unemployed, dependent people basically women into working and self-dependent women. Women won&rsquo;t be a burden anymore. People can earn with the help of their skill from home.</p>

<p><strong> 1. Back-End </strong></p>
<ol>
<ol>- Firebase</ol>
</ol>
<p align="justify">Firebase is a platform which allows building web and mobile applications without a server-side programming language. One can store users data on its real-time database which sync data among users data in no time.<br />
For the app, I have used Firebase Authentication, Real-time Database, Firebase Storage.</p>
<p align="justify"><ins><u>Firebase Authentication:</u></ins> I have used this to manage user session and to authenticate the user to the app. The app will authenticate on the basis of Email and Password.</p>
<p align="justify"><ins><u>Firebase Storage:</u></ins> It is a stand-alone solution for uploading user-generated content like images and videos from an iOS and Android device. I have used it to upload service images and profile pictures.</p>
<p align="justify"><ins><u>Firebase Database:</u></ins> The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets me store and sync data between users in realtime.The database helps the app to store service information which the user input when adding a service. The app can also use the data in real-time.</p>
<p><strong> 2. Front-End </strong></p>
<p>- JAVA</p>
<p>- KOTLIN</p>
<p align="justify">Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the JVM and is completely interoperable with Java. Kotlin is an officially supported language for developing Android apps, along with Java.</p>
<p>- XML</p>
<p><strong> 3. IDE </strong></p>
<p>- Android Studio</p>
<h2 align="center"><ins><strong> <u>Monetization/Business plan</u></strong></ins></h2>
<p align="justify">There will basically two payment methods there is cash on delivery and Bkash. If any transaction for a service is made through cash on delivery or Bkash then the service provider will have to pay a small percentage of the transaction like 3 % through Bkash. If he or she doesn&rsquo;t pay the charge then his or her account will be blocked.</p>
<p align="justify">I will promote third-party brands and products and charge them to place their offer/ logo in the app or send out a push notification. I will list other businesses and promote a specific business to the top of the list.</p>
<p align="center"><ins><strong><u>Payment Methods</u></strong></ins></p>

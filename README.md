  <strong><u><b>Project details</b> </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>Project idea:</u>
</p>
<p>
The project is about freelancing apps that’ll help unemployed people
especially the women who know to tailor, cooking, handicrafts, etc. to open
a home business and can take orders from home also can deliver with the
help of delivery service. They can use the app to be self-dependent without
any large investment.
</p>
<p>
One can post his or her service or skill on the app with proper details.
Those who need the service can order the service, can select a payment
method and can get delivered through delivery service.
</p>
<p>
The problem I am trying to solve: There are so many unemployed but skilled
people where a large number are women. I am trying to convert a large
number of skilled but unemployed, dependent people basically women into
working and self-dependent women. Women won’t be a burden anymore. People
can earn with the help of their skill from home.
</p>
<p>
The application will help unemployed people to be self-employed. They can
use the app to be self-dependent without any large investment.
</p>
<p>
Basically, earning by giving service using one’s skill and hobby.

<u><strong>Technology</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
1. Back-End


<ol> - Firebase
<p>Firebase is platform which allow to build web and mobile applications without server side programming language. One can store users data on its real-time database which sync data among users data in no time.
</p>
<p>
For the app i have used Firebase Authentication, Real time database, Firebase Storage. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Firebase Authentication:</u> I have used this to manage user serssion and to authenticate user to the app. The app will authenticate on the basis of Email and Password.
</p>
<p>
<u>Firebase Storage:</u> It is a stand-alone solution for uploading user generated content like images and videos from an iOS and Android device. 
I have used it to upload service images and profile pictures.
</p>
<p>
<u>Firebase Datbase:</u> 
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets me store and sync data between users in realtime.Database helps the app to store service information which the user input when adding a service. The app can also use the datas in real time . 
</p>

</ol>

<p>
2. Front-End
</p>
<ol>
<p>
- JAVA
</p>
<p>
- KOTLIN

</p>
<p>
Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the JVM and is completely interoperable with Java. Kotlin is an officially supported language for developing Android apps, along with Java.
</p>
<p>

<strong> <u>Monetization/Business plan</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
There will basically two payment methods there is cash on delivery and
Bkash. If any transaction for a service is made through cash on delivery or
Bkash then the service provider will have to pay a small percentage of the
transaction like 3 % through Bkash. If he or she doesn’t pay the charge
then his or her account will be blocked.
</p>
<p>
I will promote third-party brands and products and charge them to place
their offer/ logo in the app or send out a push notification. I will list
other businesses and promote a specific business to the top of the list.
</p>
<p align ="center">
<ins><strong><u>Payment Methods</u></strong></ins>
</p>
<p>
We will be using Bkash, Credit/Debit Cards as our basic payment methods for
any kind of transactions.
